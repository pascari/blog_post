  Imagine learning a new skill from scratch — no matter your current background — and getting a job that has plenty of potential for advancement. That’s QA. It requires no special background and can be done in person or online. In fact, your current background will probably help you be a great QA tester.</p>
   <p>
    While many other jobs are getting outsourced, tech jobs are so much in demand that companies can’t hire fast enough.
  
    Most programming jobs take years of education — but you can become a QA specialist in just a few months.</p>
